To be good and faithful stewards of Yahweh's resources by investing wisely for substantial returns.

General principles
- Valuation based on expected cash flows to investors
- Understanding that markets turn against investors
- Christianity is true and wise; therefore, investing in like-minded companies is financially sound
- Do not invest where sin is a primary driver of revenue
- Emphasize companies where tangible, non-derived value is constructed
